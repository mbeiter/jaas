# How to Build and Deploy this Project

## You will need:

- A working git installation
- Access to GitHub that allows you cloning of public repositories
- A working and somewhat current maven installation (tested with Maven 3.2.3)

## Optional:

- A working Fortify installation

#### Install the Fortify Maven plugin

- Go to $FORTIFY_HOME\Samples\advanced\maven-plugin
- Run `mvn clean install`    

## Developer build

### Get the repository from github

If you are building on _**Windows**_, configure git to checkout Windows style line endings and commit Unix-style line 
endings:

    git config --global core.autocrlf true 

Checkout the master branch from GitHub to a first directory:

    git clone git@github.com:mbeiter/jaas.git

or

	git clone https://github.com/mbeiter/jaas.git

Checkout the master branch from GitHub to a second directory (optional, but handy to modify the GitHub pages without 
switching branches):

    git clone git@github.com:mbeiter/jaas.git jaas-site -b gh-pages

or

	git clone https://github.com/mbeiter/jaas.git jaas-site -b gh-pages

For first-time git users: configure a default identity for git (stored in ~/.gitconfig):

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email your@email.com

Or configure a specific identity on a per-repository level (stored in <repo-root>/.git/config)

    git config user.name "Your Name"
    git config user.email your@email.com

### Make your changes

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for pointers on how to contribute.

### Make sure that all new and updated files have the correct license header 

Add / update the license header to all files

    mvn license:update-file-header

To create the project license file

    mvn license:update-project-license

### Run the Maven build

#### Option 1: Build instructions when running the Fortify SCA scan from the Fortify Workbench

- Make sure that everything builds without errors and warnings and is always ready for a release build!
- Run `mvn clean package` (this will create the target folder and resolve + copy all dependencies and sources)
- Use the audit workbench, and create a new project in "advanced" mode:
    - Set the target SDK to 1.7
    - Exclude:
         - The build-tools project 
         - All unit test directories
         - All target directories
    - Include:
         - The `main` source directories
         - The `target/dependency-sources` source directories
    - Set as classpath directory
         - All `target/classes` directories
         - All `target/dependency` directories
    - Unset as classpath directory
         - All `target/test-classes` directories
    - Make sure that all of the standard rulepacks are enabled
    - Set filters:
        - Show all issues that may have security implications
        - Show all code quality issues
        - Application is a J2EE web application
        - Application is executed with elevated privileges
- Run the Fortify scan, and make sure to update the translation
- Run `mvn clean install site -P release` from the project root (the 'release' profile is optional, see below)

For release builds, all SCA scans must pass without errors and Fortify 'Quick View' must be clean.

If you get an error message about missing dependencies during site building (e.g. JavaDoc warnings), you forgot to also
do an `install` when building the site.

#### Option 2: Build instructions when running the Fortify SCA scan from Maven

Make sure that everything builds without errors and warnings and is always ready for a release build! 

    mvn clean install site -P fortify,release -DFORTIFY_VERSION=4.20
    mvn com.fortify.ps.maven.plugin:sca-maven-plugin:scan -P fortify -DFORTIFY_VERSION=4.20

- The 'release' profile is optional for developer builds. It uses strict static code analysis settings, and any pushed
  code must pass the strict SCA settings of the 'release' profile.
- For release builds, all SCA scans must pass without errors and Fortify 'Quick View' must be clean.
- If you get an error message about missing dependencies during site building (e.g. JavaDoc warnings), you forgot to also
  do an `install` when building the site.

### Commit changes to git and push

See (Contribute.md) for hints on how to commit and what to include in commit messages.

## Release build

### Set a release version:

    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.0
    mvn versions:commit

**Note** that the version setting will not affect the `build-tools` component, because it is not part of the main Maven 
project! It is intentionally kept separate to allow referencing it as a build properties root from within the project.

### Build the release bits and site, and push the release bits to Maven Central staging

Using the "release" profile is mandatory, and the Fortify 'Quick View' must be clean.

The "codesigning" profile is mandatory, as the bits will not be accepted by the upstream repository without a signature.

    mvn clean deploy site -P fortify,release,codesigning -DFORTIFY_VERSION=4.20
    mvn com.fortify.ps.maven.plugin:sca-maven-plugin:scan -P fortify -DFORTIFY_VERSION=4.20

For automated builds on a single-user machine, it is okay to specify the passphrase of the GPG signing key:

    mvn clean deploy site -P fortify,release,codesigning -Dgpg.passphrase=keyPassphrase -DFORTIFY_VERSION=4.20
    mvn com.fortify.ps.maven.plugin:sca-maven-plugin:scan -P fortify -DFORTIFY_VERSION=4.20

### Stage the site 

    mvn site:stage
    
- Check that the information is correct 
- Check that the site was built correctly and that intra-project links work

### Push the site to Github

- Copy the staging folder to the "gh-pages" branch in the correct version folder (e.g. `[...]/docs/1.0/]
- Commit and push, using "Release 1.0 documentation" as the commit message
- Update the project start page with a link to the new documentation, and make sure that the link works 
- Check if the site looks okay on GitHub pages

### Promote the bits from the staging area to Maven Central

Go to the [Sonatype staging repo](https://oss.sonatype.org/) and promote the build.

### Commit release version change to git and tag

    mvn clean
    git status
    git add . -A
    git commit -m "Release 1.0 prep"
    git tag -a 1.0 -m "Release 1.0"

### Set a SNAPSHOT Version (increment of current release version number):

    mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.1-SNAPSHOT
    mvn versions:commit
    git status
    git add . -A
    git commit -m "1.1 SNAPSHOT prep"

### Push to GitHub

    git push
